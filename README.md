# E-Commerce Product Recommendation System

## Overview

The goal of ths project is to create a Product Recommendation System that enhaces the customer experience and increase sales. The system recommends products using machine learning methods based on user Interactions, purchase history and product similarities.

This project is built on an Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) I performed on e-commerce sales data.

## Features

Personalized product recommedations

Various Recommendation Methods: Hybrid, Content-based, and Collaborative Filtering

Data Processing and Model Training using Scikit-Learn

Interactive Visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib

## Data Exploration (Previous Findings)

Before building the recommendation system, I performed an exploratory analysis and found:

    Electronics is the most popular category, mostly tech gadgets.

    Although many items are discounted by more than 50%, discounts dont alwasy Increase sales, product quality and general customer satisfaction matter.

    Some highly discounted items barely sell, while other low-rated items continue to sell well.

    Office products receive high ratings but sell in low quantitites.

    Based on these findings I developed a system to Improve customer engagement and sales.
